#  Python Mini Projects Showcase

A collection of beginner-friendly and intermediate Python projects to sharpen your programming, logic-building, and GUI skills.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Snake Water Gun Game

A fun and interactive Python game inspired by the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this variation, the player chooses between Snake, Water, or Gun to compete against the computer's random choice. The game uses conditional logic to determine the winner and keeps the player engaged with each round.


## ðŸ”¹ Project 2: Guess The Number

A simple yet addictive number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100). The game provides feedback such as "Too high" or "Too low" until the player finds the correct number. Great for practicing loops and conditional statements.


## ðŸ”¹ Project 3: Jarvis Virtual Assistant

An AI-powered virtual assistant built with Python. It responds to voice commands and performs tasks like playing music, searching the web, opening apps, giving weather updates, and more. Integrates libraries such as `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `datetime` to simulate a smart assistant experience.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 4: AI AutoReply Bot

An intelligent message auto-responder bot that uses basic AI logic to reply to common queries. Ideal for simulating customer service or chatbot functionality. It can be enhanced using NLP libraries like NLTK or transformers to make responses smarter and more context-aware.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 5: Password Generator (GUI)

A secure password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Python and Tkinter**. It generates strong 28-character passwords using a combination of letters, digits, and special symbols. The clean interface includes a text entry box and a button to generate passwords with a single click.

### ðŸ“– About Tkinter

> Tkinter is the **standard GUI toolkit** for Python. It allows developers to build desktop applications with interactive elements like windows, buttons, labels, and text inputs. It's simple, beginner-friendly, and doesn't require external installation as it's included with Python by default.
